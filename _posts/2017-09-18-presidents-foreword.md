SMiTA Malaysia was incorporated with a mission to assist all SMEs to trade internationally as the world has now transformed into a borderless market with so many FTAs being signed, trade barriers being lifted, procedures being harmonized and many new markets being discovered.
​
SMiTA is Malaysia's premier international trade organisation providing a strong platform and professional advice and guidance to entrepreneurs who are either thinking of going into international business or who are already doing business internationally, be it in manufacturing, services or trading.
​
We are a highly active group that aims to bring to SMEs the tools they need to succeed, while at the same time working to provide more information on current market situation and work closely together with government ministries and agencies at all levels to promote international trade.
​
One of my great joys is providing guidelines to budding young entrepreneurs trying to make their mark in the business world and then tracking their road to success.
​
However, many times I have seen vibrant and innovative businesses suffer due to the constraints imposed by the indifference of bureaucracy and the ever increasing web of red tape they must navigate to keep their doors open.
​
We understand that running business at SMEs level is tough and challenging. But every successful business started with a bold first step. And the first step we are referring here is to the international market and probably unknown to many SMEs.
​
The SMEs business owner sometimes has to be a Jack of all trades, managing tasks that a bigger business would either outsource or employ specialists to manage.
​
Yet SMEs account for more than half of the jobs created in the private sector and their survival is integral to the national's economic health.
​
Our core objective is to enhance the rate of success and minimise the rate of failure in SMEs contribution to the country economy, and to promote the world's best practice in business through our action plans.
​
SMiTA are proud and honoured to be the partner of Dept of Standards Malaysia, a government agency and accreditation body that overseeing the accreditation 6000 standards in the country.
​
We work closely together to promote Standards Malaysia as the benchmark of export. This will help our Malaysia products and services to have a better edge in terms of competitiveness and sustainability in the international market.
​
SMiTA pledge to do its utmost best to assist all SMEs to venture successfully into the international market.
​
If you are in line with our mission and objective, I would certainly urge you to join SMiTA and work with us to achieve a better deal for the 650,000 SMEs all over Malaysia.
